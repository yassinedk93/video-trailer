# Video Trailer

This project is a demo for the integration of a video in simple `html` and `css` Web page.

You should paste an mp4 file named `video_trailer.mp4` inside the project. We ignored the file because of its size.

## Run

We run the project using VSCode option `Open with Live Server` in the `project.html` file.
